A fan made addon to Terraria mod The Stars Above

Credit to PaperLuigi, the creator of The Stars Above, for giving me the permission to make this mod.

Because the Spirit Blossom weapon is an upgrade to an existing weapon in the mod (the Unforgotten), it shares much of its functionality with its predecessor. As a result, much of the code used in this project is borrowed from that weapon, with modifications where I made changes or addons.

Since there is no GitHub page for The Stars Above, at least not to my knowledge, this is the only way I know of crediting him.
